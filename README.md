This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I developed a demonstration of a travel advisor, containing vacation destinations, images and their locations.
This web-app was developed using react.js. I created a mock json database file and passed it into my app as a mock external api source. This
file contained the different destinations, location and more information aout the guide.

I used the react router dom to create routes to different pages in the app, then passed the required information needed as props.

I then went on to improve the features by adding  an open source map and displayed it on the app.this help users see the exact
location of their destination directly on the app. 

HOW THE APP WORKS
When the app loads at first, users can navigate to the differnt locations, click on the "see more" link and see the different descriptions 
for their destinations. The return button icon helps then navigate back to the home page. They can also click on the "see on google maps" button
to see the exact location of their destination on the map.
