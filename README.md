This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
I developed a demonstration of a travel advisor, containing vacation destinations, images and their locations.
this web-app was developed using react.js. i called a seperate file and passed it into my app as props. this
gave me the different dastinations , location and minformation aout them.

I also used the react router dom to create routes to different pages in the app. and passeg the required information needed as props.
Then i used leaflet.js an open source map, displayed it on the app so as to help users see the exact location of their destination on
the map. 

HOW THE APP WORKS
When the app loads at first, users can navigate to the differnt locations, click on the see more link amd see the different descriptions 
for their destinations. the return button icon helps then navigate ack to the home page. they can also click on the see on google maps button
to see the exact location of their destination on the map.
